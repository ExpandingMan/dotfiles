## useful things that I always forget
Here I will store some information on useful things that I frequently forget.

- `apt search`: This is a slightly nicer version of `apt-cache search`.
- `ldconfig -p`: Lists all libraries in library paths. For example do `ldconfig -p | grep libsdl` to find SDL libraries.
